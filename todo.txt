- Mxfp4Reader
    - Input: file_path, mxfp4_tensor_config
    - At init:
        - create 2 file readers (scales and blocks) at correct offsets
        - store states (block buffer, isBufferEmpty flag - for first loop, blockCount, and tensor metadata)
    - Stream:
        - Until the limit is reached: write block buffer & dequantize new block
        - Return 0 if blockCount is reached
- Safetensors parser
    - Input: file_path
    - Output: arrayList of mxfp4 tensor configs
- Full system
    - Input: file_path
    - Parses a safetensors file
    - Returns an arrayList of Mxfp4Reader
